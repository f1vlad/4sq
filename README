Using a hidden (Â¿?) 4sq feature to show anyone's last know location

Edit 4sq.py file:
- Specify your foursquare username whose location you want to fetch: user = "...".
- Specify file to which location would be written: output_path = "...".
- Check first line to make sure path to python binary is correct.

Test it by running $ ./4sq.py and checking output file. If necessary _touch_ output file
giving it proper permissions.
